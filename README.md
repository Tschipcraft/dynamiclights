## Features

Supported entities and items such as torches or lanterns will emit light by using the light block added in 21w13a. Because of this, the dynamic lights are limited to the block grid. (see [#9](https://github.com/Tschipcraft/dynamiclights/issues/9) for more information)

**Supported Items:** Torches, Lanterns, Campfires, Glowstone, Glowstone Dust, Blaze Rods, Blaze Powder, Spectral Arrows, Lava Buckets, Sea Lanterns, Prismarine Crystals, Froglights, Glow Ink Sacs, Glow Berries, Glow Item Frames, Glow Lichen, Jack o'Lanterns, Shroomlights, End Rods, End Crystals, Fire Charge, Amethyst Shards, Nether Stars, Ender Chests and Beacons

Additionally, all enchanted items will emit light level 6 while Fire Aspect, Riptide or Channeling enchanted items emit light level 9.

**Supported Entities:** Allays, Glow Squids, Glow Item Frames, Blazes, TNT, End Crystals, Fireballs, Spectral Arrows, Shulker Bullets, Firework Rockets and Flying Wither Skulls

Since this project is completely server-side, players joining a server with Dynamic Lights installed do not have to install anything on their end for it to work! Nontheless, you can still use the mod on
the client for singleplayer worlds only. Joining a server that has not installed Dynamic Lights will have no effect.

[âžœ For available settings and planned features, take a look at the wiki](https://github.com/Tschipcraft/dynamiclights/wiki)
